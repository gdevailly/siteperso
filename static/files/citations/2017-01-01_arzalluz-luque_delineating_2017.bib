  abstract = {Single cell transcriptomics is becoming a common technique to unravel new biological phenomena whose functional significance can only be understood in the light of differences in gene expression between single cells. The technology is still in its early days and therefore suffers from many technical challenges. This review discusses the continuous effort to identify and systematically characterise various sources of technical variability in single cell expression data and the need to further develop experimental and computational tools and resources to help deal with it.},
