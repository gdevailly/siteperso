<h2>Graphical abstract:</h2>

<hr />
<p>Molecular biologists and biochemists are quite sensitive on the topic of DNA representation.
Many of them will be triggered when the looping of the DNA is misrepresented as a left-handed helix instead of a right-handed one
(what we mean by that is that when one looks at DNA from ‚Äòwithin‚Äô the helix, they turn clock-wise as they get more distant).
I am not quite offended by this mistake, as I hardly remember if (B-)DNA is right-handed or left-handed,
and what right-handed and left-handed means in the context of an helix.</p>
<p>I am paying more attention to the fact that the DNA double-helix has <strong>two grooves of unequal size</strong>, one big <strong>major groove</strong>,
and a narrow <strong>minor groove</strong>. It matters because transcription factors can bind either to the major groove
or to the minor groove, and the rules governing their sequence specificity won‚Äôt be the same in each case.</p>
<p>I sometimes do complain about that:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Should someone tell them about the whole major/minor groove thing? <a href="https://t.co/KPq9iFkUge">https://t.co/KPq9iFkUge</a>

<hr />
<p>My other pet peeve is when artistic views of DNA show unnecessary ‚Äúasperities‚Äù in the texture of DNA to ‚Äúmake it more real‚Äù
<strong>while still representing a very basic rope-ladder shape</strong>.</p>
<p>For examples:
<img src="/img/posts/bad_dna_ladder.png" /></p>
<p>These visualisations are so popular that any efforts to name and shame will results in either naming the entire universe or hand picking some for biased reasons. I‚Äôll hand pick one nonetheless: the homepage of <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/">Genome Biology</a>. üòë</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/bad_dna_gb.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>It seems that at some point, some artists began to realise that the DNA rope-ladder was actually made of atoms.
They decided to represent atoms as spheres, which make sense. But instead of positioning the spheres on realistic positions,
or by simply downloading available 3D models, they did that:</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/dna-thegrowthop.jpg" /></p>
<p>ü§¶</p>
<p>And the endless list of bad DNA visualisation goes on.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/bad_dna_pearl.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>I find those view annoying, because we have known the exact structure of the B DNA helix for a long time, with many 3D models freely available! One could take those, apply a bumpy fluorescent blue texture in front of a black background
and produce similarly impressive artistic views that would be <strong>much closer to the reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me try to be clearer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>my rant is not against the <em>rope and ladder</em> view of DNA. It is a useful representation, but for diagram and such.</p></li>
<li><p>it is not against artistic views, they are both useful and often spectacular when well done.</p></li>
<li><p>it is about one <strong>bad</strong> type of artistic view that is representing DNA as a ‚Äúrope and ladder‚Äù while adding asperities to make it more <em>realistic</em>, ignoring that the atomic structures of DNA had been known since before I was born.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, the brilliant <a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/23">PDB‚Äôs molecule of the month team</a> offers us some hope. Let‚Äôs all admire the DNA molecule:
<img src="/img/posts/good-dna.gif" /></p>
<hr />
<p>But enough complaining for today, let‚Äôs try to be a bit more constructive and build our own <strong>scientifically accurate artistic view of DNA with R</strong>!</p>
<p>First we download and parse the PDB structure <code>1BNA</code>, which is a structure file of a 12 nucleotide long DNA double helix in B shape. Let‚Äôs use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=bio3d">CRAN package</a> <code>bio3d</code>:</p>

<p>We use the <code>rayrender</code> <a href="https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayrender">package</a> to hand-craft our scientifically accurate artistic view of a DNA molecule. It is a quite new ray-tracing tool, not particularly designed to render macro-molecules. This means that we have to do some dirty work ourselves.</p>
<p>First we centre the molecule coordinates, to be able to point the virtual camera to the centre of the DNA molecule by simply targeting the XYZ point: <code>c(0, 0, 0)</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summarise_if(dnamod, is.numeric, min)

<p>We create a look-up table containing some details about each atom in the molecule. We use some standard, non-artistic, colours first:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>unique(dnamod$atom)
## [1] &quot;O&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;P&quot;

elref &lt;- tribble(
    ~atom, ~atomic_mass, ~color,
    &quot;C&quot;, 12, &quot;lightgrey&quot;,
    &quot;N&quot;, 14, &quot;darkblue&quot;,
    &quot;O&quot;, 16, &quot;darkred&quot;,
    &quot;P&quot;, 31, &quot;darkorange&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>Now let‚Äôs build our model. Rayrender‚Äôs function <code>sphere()</code> is not entirely vectorised. The <code>x, y, z</code> parameters seem vectorised: you can render several spheres with one function call by passing vectors in <code>x, y, z</code> parameters. But as far as I understand, they have to share the non vectorised <code>material</code> parameter. Therefore we call <code>sphere()</code> 4 times, one for the carbon atoms, one for the oxygen, one for the nitrogen, and one for the phosphorus, using <code>purrr::map_dfr()</code> to be fancy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rayrender)
library(purrr)

mol &lt;-  map_dfr(
    unique(dnamod$atom), # one iteration for each tom type, C, N, O, P
    function(ato) {
        melref = filter(elref, atom == ato)
        dnamo = filter(dnamod, atom == ato)
        sphere(
            x = dnamo$x, y = dnamo$y, z = dnamo$z,
            radius = 0.4 * melref$atomic_mass^(1/3),
            # radius is proportionnal to the cubic root of the atomic mass. 
            # 0.4 is a magic number leading to a visualisation that doesn&#39;t look too bad.
            material = diffuse(color = melref$color)
        )
    }
)</code></pre>
<p>We now render our first scene. Rayrender is basically ray-tracing on CPU, which means it is quite slow. So it‚Äôs best to render small scenes first to find the appropriate parameters, before rendering a beautiful one once you are happy with the scene.</p>
<p>A scene is composed of objects (here described in the <code>mol</code> tibble), and a camera that has a location, and point to something.
We centred our object, so we tell the camera to point at <code>c(0, 0, 0)</code>. It‚Äôs probably best if the camera is somewhere outside of the object. I played a bit with the <code>lookfrom</code> parameter, and found the values <code>c(60, 0, -10)</code> reasonably satisfying. So behold the following rendering:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>render_scene(
    mol,
    lookfrom = c(60, 0, -10),
    lookat = c(0, 0, 0),
    parallel = TRUE, width = 800, height = 500, samples = 100,
    backgroundhigh = &quot;white&quot;, backgroundlow = &quot;white&quot;
)</code></pre>

<p>Now let‚Äôs try to render this non-artistic, a bit boring, view of DNA into an artistic one. I‚Äôm no artist, but let‚Äôs put a darker background, two light sources of different colours, and an invisible metallic mirror in the background to generate some dirty reflections to make the scene less empty. Let‚Äôs also pick fairly neutral colours for the atoms, and fiddle with the camera <code>aperture</code> and <code>focal distance</code>.</p>

        sphere(
            x = dnamo$x, y = dnamo$y, z = dnamo$z,
            radius = 0.4 * (melref$atomic_mass)^(1/3),

<p>Not bad! My main regret is that the PDB DNA structure <code>1BNA</code> is only 12 nucleotide long. A longer DNA model might be more suitable for artistic representations, but I was too lazy to search for one or build one myself (too bad for you, 16-nucleoride long structure <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3BSE">3BSE</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p>To conclude, I‚Äôll offer a stay-at-home challenge: try to render your own scientifically accurate artistic view of the DNA molecule, for example by changing a few parameters from this post‚Äô script. Then post it on twitter mentioning me (<a href="https://twitter.com/G_Devailly">G_Devailly</a>), the winner will be retweeted! üéâ</p>
