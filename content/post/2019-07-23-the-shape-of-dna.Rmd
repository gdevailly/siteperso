Molecular biologists and biochemists are an easily triggered crowd, 
especially when it's a matter of DNA representation.
Many of them will be triggered when the looping of the DNA will be mis-represented as an left-handed helix instead of an right-handed one
(what we mean by that is that when one looks at DNA from 'within' the helix, they turn clok-wise as they get more distant).
I tends to be not quite easily offended by this mistake, as I have hard tim remebering if (B-)DNA is right handed or left handed, 
and I also tend to forget what right-handed and left-handed means in the context of an helix.

One of my personal trigger is that the DNA double-helix has **two grooves of inequal size**, one big **major groove**, 
and a narrow **minor groove**. It matters because transcription factors can bind either to the major groove
or to the minor groove, and the rules governing their sequence specificity won't be the same in each cases.

I sometimes do complain about that:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should someone tell them about the whole major/minor groove thing? <a href="https://t.co/KPq9iFkUge">https://t.co/KPq9iFkUge</a></p>&mdash; Guillaume Devailly (@G_Devailly) <a href="https://twitter.com/G_Devailly/status/1073290319716847616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

as others do:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GREAT! But &lt;pedant=ON&gt; NO MAJOR/MINOR GROOVE!!! See example below from <a href="https://twitter.com/PDBeurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PDBeurope</a> &lt;/pedant=OFF&gt; :-) ;-)<a href="https://t.co/1rX87naLgg">https://t.co/1rX87naLgg</a></p>&mdash; Geoff Barton ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º (@gjbarton) <a href="https://twitter.com/gjbarton/status/1073265247832678401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

and guess what, complaining on twitter can sometime have an impact!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The great christmas elves in the <a href="https://twitter.com/emblebi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emblebi</a> comms department have created your handy, right handed (right) from left handed (wrong), minor groove containing card for genomics comms professionals.

My other pet peeve is when artistic views of DNA shows unessecary "asperities" in the texture of DNA to "make it more real"
while still representing a very basic rope-ladder shape.

For example:
![Bad artistic view of DNA](/img/posts/dna-zdnet.jpg)

Or:
![Bad artistic view of DNA, number 2](/img/posts/dna-science.jpg)

Or this (I didn't knew DNA could host a star?):
![Another bad artistic view of DNA](/img/posts/dna-ejhg.jpg)

Or this spectacularly bad view:
![Spectaularly bad artistic view of DNA](/img/posts/dna-phys.jpg)

I find those view particularly stupid, because we have known the exact structure of the B DNA helix since quite
a long time, with many 3D models freely availables! One could take those, apply a bumpy fluorescent blue texture in front of a black background
and produce similarly impressive artistic views that woud be much closer to the reality.

So, curtesy of the brillant [PDB's protein of the month team](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/23), let me introduce the DNA molecule:
![Good DNA](/img/posts/good-dna.jpg)

It seems that at some point, some artists began to realise that the DNA rope-ladder was actually made of atoms.
They decided to represent atoms as spheres, which make sense. But instead of postionned the sphere on realistic positions,
or by simply downloading 3D models, they did that:

And this:

And that:

And the endlest list of bad DNA visualisation goes on, and on, and one:
