summary: 'eQTL detection in pigs raised in two different climates'
---

The PigHeaT project aims at gathering multi-omics data sets in a back-cross between
Large White pigs (productive, but sensible to heat waves) anc French Cr√©ole pigs,
less sensitives to heat-waves.
Back-crossed pigs were raised either in temperate or tropical climates.

I am investigating how genetics influences the expression of pig genes in the blood,
and how it interacts with the pig environments, notably by detecting expression QTLs (eQTL).

We will soon also investigate the blood DNA methylome in the same samples.
