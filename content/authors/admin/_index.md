I am a researcher in farm animal genetics and epigenetics at GenPhySE, INRAE, located in Toulouse, France. 
I joined the GenEpi team there in 2017, after a postdoctoral position in Anagha Joshi’s group at the Roslin Institute (Edinburgh, UK).

Now a computational biologist, I started at the bench studying binding sites of the DNA methylation reader MBD2 during oncogenic transformation during my PhD.
In my postdoc, I developed visualisations and webtools of transcriptomic and epigenomic data, including [Heat*seq](https://joshiapps.cbu.uib.no/HeatStarSeq_gh/application/heatstarseq/) and [PEREpigenomics](https://joshiapps.cbu.uib.no/perepigenomics_app/).

I am building up my geneticist skills at INRAE, doing [eQTL detection in pigs](https://gdevailly.netlify.app/project/pigheat/),
[FAANG data visualisations](https://gdevailly.netlify.app/project/vizfada/),
and planning projects in [satiety regulation](https://gdevailly.netlify.app/project/rosepigs/) through induced epi-mutations.
