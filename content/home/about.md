# Biography

Guillaume Devailly is a researcher in farm animal genetics and epigenetics at
[GenPhySE](https://genphyse.toulouse.inra.fr/), [INRA](http://institut.inra.fr/en),
located in Toulouse, France. He joined the [GenEpi](https://genphyse.toulouse.inra.fr/groups/genepi)
team there in 2017, after a postdoctoral position in Anagha Joshi's group at the 
[Roslin Institute](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin) (Edinburgh, UK).

Now a computational biologist, Guillaume Devailly started at the bench
[studying](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007656)
binding sites of the DNA methylation reader MBD2 during oncogenic transformation
during is PhD. During his postdoc, he developed visualisations and webtools
of transcriptomic and epigenomic data, including [Heat*seq](http://www.heatstarseq.roslin.ed.ac.uk/)
and [PEREpigenomics](http://www.perepigenomics.roslin.ed.ac.uk/). 
He is building up his geneticist skills at INRA, doing eQTL detection in pigs, and
planning projects in satiety regulation through induced epi-mutations.
